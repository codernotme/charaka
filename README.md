## 🩺 Problem Statement

In today’s fast-paced world, real-time health monitoring and immediate medical response remain critical yet underserved needs, particularly for vulnerable groups such as elderly individuals, patients with chronic illnesses, and fitness-conscious individuals. These populations often face challenges in continuously tracking vital health parameters, leading to missed early warning signs of medical emergencies. Moreover, the lack of decentralized and readily accessible medical records further exacerbates delays in diagnosis and treatment. This fragmented approach to healthcare not only increases the risk of complications and mortality but also contributes to inefficient, reactive healthcare services rather than proactive, personalized care. There is an urgent need for a robust, real-time, and decentralized health monitoring ecosystem to ensure timely interventions, improved patient outcomes, and optimized resource allocation in the healthcare system.
